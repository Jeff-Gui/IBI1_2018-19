In this practical, I learnt that files in specific folder can be created in folder under a repository through following steps:
Click "View all files";
Move the cursor on the folder;
Right click, then click on "create a file in this folder".
*
Additionally, click command+P opens "fuzzy finder" so that I can search for certain command.
    For example, create an file.

During the pratical, I wondered how to edit the git page <username>.git.io through Readme.md.
Mela told me that if index.md and Readme.md coexist in the repository of the page,
git will only use the information in index.md.
When index.md is deleted, then Readme.md can be used to edit the git page.
