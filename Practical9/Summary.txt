Summary:

human ~ mouse
BLOSUM62 score: 1091 
Identity: 89.64%

mouse ~ random
BLOSUM62 score: -250 
Identity: 5.86%

human ~ random
BLOSUM62 score: -250 
Identity: 5.41%

Human and mouse genes coding SOD2 protein are quite similar with nearly 90% identity.
If two sequence are similar, there BLOSUM62 score is very large because amino acids remaining unchanged have positive scores. Substituted pairs have negative scores.

Interestingly, sequence with the same BLOSUM62 scores can have different identity levels.
